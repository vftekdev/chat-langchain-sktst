                        SEEK is an exploratory project for VERA Files. Our team has been learning about AI and its applications in journalism since 2022, and winning a grant under the JournalismAI Innovation Challenge in 2024 gave us the seed money to put our newfound knowledge to the test.

                        <br/><br/>We wanted to address a challenge we have with distribution: ‚ÄúHow do we make it easy for our audiences to search for facts?‚Äù

                        <br/><br/>From here came the idea to birth SEEK, which is designed to take the extra work out of online searching for people interested in fact checking and understanding misinformation trends.

                            SEEK is an AI-powered search assistant that uses over 5,400 VERA Files articles (and counting) as its knowledge base and a Large Language Model (i.e. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, specifically for SEEK) to craft an answer.

                            <br/><br/>When you ask a question, it will search its knowledge base according to how it understands your question (i.e. meaning-based search or semantic search). The retrieved parts of articles are then sent together with SEEK's instructions to the LLM to give you an answer. 
                            However, LLMs by nature are non-deterministic* and may misunderstand or hallucinate, that is why we keep a reminder in our app for you to always read the cited stories.

                            <br/><br/>Non-determinism, in the context of LLMs, means that the product can produce different outputs (i.e. the answer you get may vary) even when given the same input (your prompt).

                            The Team updates SEEK's knowledge base every Monday at 10 a.m. with the most recent stories published on the VERA Files website.

                            <br/><br/>SEEK's knowledge base is built on fact checks, fact sheets, news articles, and in-depth reports published on <a className="hover:border-0" href="https://verafiles.org" target="_blank">verafiles.org</a> since 2008. 
                            Apart from those authored by VERA Files staff, this also includes analyses by Tsek.ph, select articles by freelance journalists, and in-depth reports by the UP Third World Studies Center*.

                            <br/><br/>*UP TWSC has a publishing agreement with VERA Files, where the latter publishes articles written by the Center's <a className="hover:border-0" href="https://diktadura.upd.edu.ph/">Marcos Regime Research</a> group and the <a className="hover:border-0" href="https://dahas.upd.edu.ph/">Dahas project</a>. 
                            The SEEK Team at VERA Files obtained their permission to include their articles before adding them to SEEK's knowledge base.

The SEEK Team has, however, done several tests and evaluations to improve the chatbot and, as much as possible, prevent misunderstanding or hallucinations.

                            <br/><br/>üìñ For those who prefer to read instructions:

                            <br/><br/>1. Report an issue through the Report Issue form.  

                            <ul className="indent-8 text-sm">
                                <li>There are two ways where you can go to the Report Issue form.</li>
                                <li>a - On the top right corner of the header</li>
                                <li>b - At the bottom</li>

                            <br/>This is what the Report Issue Form looks like.

                            <br/>3. In the Bug Title, just enter a general Issue statement, e.g. ‚ÄúMali ang sagot,‚Äù ‚ÄúUnresponsive app‚Äù
                            <br/>4. For the SEEK team to investigate the issue, in the Bug overview, we need the following information:

                                <li>The specific issue you are reporting (e.g. spotted wrong information, you didn't receive an answer, etc.)</li>

                            To ensure the quality of responses from SEEK, the Team employed a combination of human annotators and LLM-as-a-judge in evaluating the tool.

                            <br/><br/>The Team has developed a ‚ÄúGolden Dataset‚Äù of 100 question-and-answer (QA) pairs. This dataset is a well-defined, human-labeled, and trusted subset of data based on fact checks, fact sheets and reports from 2008 to the present. 
                            Four human editors drafted the ground truth answers, or the ideal responses, per question and performed peer reviews of each other's contributions.  

                            <br/><br/>After this process, we used gpt-4o-mini to judge the responses based on RAGAS metrics, an open-source framework for testing and evaluating LLM applications. It has four metrics related to Retrieval and Answer Generation:

                            <br/>As of July 28, 2025, the SEEK team has conducted four runs of 50 QA pairs. The overall mean RAGAS score is <span className="font-helveticaneue">0.71</span>, indicating good performance.

                            <br/><br/><span className="font-helveticaneue">What does it mean if SEEK has a good score?</span>

                            <br/><br/>Based on our tests, SEEK earned high scores in generating accurate answers, but scored poorly in context relevancy. 
                            This means that the Large Language Model behind SEEK, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, is doing a good job of avoiding hallucinations and producing answers that directly address your questions. 
                            However, the tool needs improvement in omitting extraneous details from the sources from which it draws its answers.

                                    <br/>There are technical factors why SEEK is unable to give you an answer.  

                                    <br/><br/>Because SEEK interacts with Anthropic's Claude LLM to generate an answer, it could happen that when you are conversing with SEEK, the Anthropic servers are experiencing heavy load or technical issues. That is why SEEK didn't get to the point of receiving an answer from Claude.

                                    <br/><br/>It can also be because SEEK has reached its cap usage. By default, LLMs implement a rate limit per minute to deter abuse of use.

                                    <br/><br/>But this could also be a network connectivity issue from your end to the SEEK servers.

                                    <br/><br/>What to do when this happens? Just take a break for 10-15 minutes, create a new chat  before asking your questions.

                                    <br/>As an AI search assistant for VERA Files, a few things can affect SEEK's response time:

                                    <br/><br/>1. When it needs to search through a large database of fact checks to find relevant information, it can take a moment to process and organize that data.

                                    <br/><br/>2. SEEK is trying to verify specific claims against multiple fact checks, as such, it needs time to cross-reference information accurately.

                                    <br/><br/>3. Sometimes it needs to carefully consider how to present complex information about misinformation in a clear, accurate way without oversimplifying.

                                    <br/><br/>4. Technical factors like network connectivity or processing capacity can occasionally cause delays.

                                    <br/><br/>SEEK is designed to be thorough rather than rushed, since accuracy is crucial in fact-checking work. That said, the SEEK Team is constantly evaluating and improving SEEK's performance to provide faster responses while maintaining quality.
